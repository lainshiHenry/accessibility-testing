# @axe-core/watcher

Watcher automatically:

1. Adds accessibility scans to your end-to-end tests. Change a few lines of configuration code and you're ready to go.
2. Sends results to [axe Developer Hub](https://docs.deque.com/developer-hub).

From axe Developer Hub, software teams can get actionable reports. The reports are amazing because:

1. Accessibility issues are deduplicated!
2. Reports are "git aware", making it easy to spot new issues caused by your code changes. No more wading through technical debt.
3. Issues are prioritized by impact, helping you focus on the most important issues first.

Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer, and Webdriver frameworks are all supported. Test results can be integrated with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.deque.com/developer-hub/2/en/dh-github-action) and a REST endpoint is provided so that other CI/CD systems are easy to setup.

Deque Systems has a [free and paid plan](https://www.deque.com/axe/developer-hub/) available, making axe Developer Hub suitable for all types of projects - open-source to enterprise.

For support on axe-core, watcher, and accessibility in general, please join the [axe community Slack](https://accessibility.deque.com/axe-community).
